    <h4><em>It's not the best, but it's still pretty good.</em></h4>
    
    <p>The "PUB" is a graphical UML Editor that allows the user to create, edit, and save UML diagrams in multiple formats for use in the software development lifecycle. It was developed as a class project for CSCI 420: Software Engineering taught by Dr. David Hutchens at Millersville University in Spring 2015.</p>
